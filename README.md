# FPAssistant Sample App
This is a sample WinForms app to show how you can develop aviation apps using the FPAssistant Suite SDK covering general aviation tools along with parts of the ICAO PANS-OPS and FAA TERPS procedure design criteria's; this app is best used in conjunction with any existing procedure design software product you already have to concur calculations and any analysis that might have been derived. Or as examples of using the SDK. 

***If there us an example you would like to see then please make contact with your suggestions and we'll see if we can add some code to get you going.***

This app is developed using the FPAssistant Suite SDK which is available to license for your own software development projects covering Desktop, Tablet or mobile devices using the .Net development software tools. Both Intel/AMD and ARM options are available for 32 & 64 bit upon request.

FPAssistant app calculations within the SDK are fully validated by unit testing using test cases available in ICAO and FAA documentation and these test cases are available to assist in the compliance and software validation needed by these authorities.

Features:
 - ARINC424 Parser
 - FAS Data Block: Encoding
 - Geodetic calculations (Great Circle, Distance, Destination, etc)
 - UTM (WGS-84 & NAD83)  <-> Latitude/Longitude coordinate conversions
 - ICAO PANS-OPS Calculations (Doc 8168, Annex 14, Annex 5)
 - ICAO Web API Data Service Helper API
 - FAA TERPS Calculations (8260)
 - RNP AR - ICAO Doc 9905 & FAA
 - Aerodrome Surfaces (FAA & ICAO)
 - NOTAMS

The FPAssistant Suite SDK available to license for your own aviation software development and software development consultancy services can be arranged to, please contact CADology for further information.

*Updates*
Added GeoCoordinate form to show how geo-coordinate struct is used
